# W3Schools Database (SQLite Version)

I adapted AndrejPHP's code to integrate the W3Schools database to Python with SQLite3.
To go to the original repository, use this link: https://github.com/AndrejPHP/w3schools-database

This repository contains the SQL and Python codes to create and manipulate the W3Schools database with SQLite3.

The w3Schools' SQL tutorial is here:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp

When the SQL file is executed, it creates a database with the following tables:

    categories
    customers
    employees
    orders
    order_details
    products
    shippers
    suppliers
    
and inserts the respective data. <br>
